HookPress turns your WordPress-internal hooks into webhooks. Possible uses include generating push notifications or extending WordPress with non-PHP.

== Description ==

Webhooks are a simple paradigm for developing instant notifications and mashups based on simple HTTP requests. With HookPress you can set up webhooks so that a specified URL (a public service or something you set up) is requested when certain WordPress actions occur. Possible uses include generating push notifications or using non-PHP web technology to extend WordPress.

**To learn about the various hooks WordPress provides**, please consult the WordPress Plugin API's [Action Reference](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference) and [Filter Reference](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference). Not all hooks are supported yet, but more are in the works.

**To learn more about webhooks**, take a look at the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) and also [The Pushbutton Web](http://dashes.com/anil/2009/07/the-pushbutton-web-realtime-becomes-real.html) by Anil Dash. Webhooks champion Jeff Lindsay's [excellent slides](http://www.slideshare.net/progrium/using-web-hooks) are a particularly good place to start.

**To write and host a target script** The easiest option is to set up a script on your own server to catch POST requests and act on them. [Requestbin](http://requestb.in/) is a nice, free service which will host an endpoint, collect all requests, and let you inspect them, which is a great way to test requests generated by your webhooks. There is also a PHP script which does a simple version of this, `test.php`, included with HookPress.

== Installation ==

Upload the HookPress plugin to your blog's `wp-content/plugins/` directory and activate. In the admin section, go to Settings > Webhooks to add new webhooks.

= How does HookPress affect performance? =

HookPress currently makes requests synchronously so can measurably affect performance. I highly recommend using a caching plugin such as [WP-SuperCache](http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-super-cache/) to stem the performance hit. If your filters' results are time-sensitive or dependent on external data sources as well, make sure to set an appropriate cache expiration time.
